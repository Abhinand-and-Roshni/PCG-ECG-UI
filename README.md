# Purpose
This project was created as part of Anna University's undergraduate capstone. 
The purpose of this capstone project is to implement and evaluate multiple techniques for classifying heart signals, specifically Phonocardiogram and Electrocardiogram signals, using two different approaches: signal processing and image processing. 
The project utilizes two datasets, PhysioNet/CinC-2016 and PhysioNet/CinC-2017, to carry out experiments and evaluate the effectiveness of the different techniques. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop improved methods for accurately classifying heart signals, which can have significant applications in the medical technology field.
